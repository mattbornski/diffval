diffval - an introduction
=========================

diffval is a tool for validating expected behavior of scripts, programs,
and packages.  The basic mechanism for separating good behavior from bad
behavior is the diff tool.  Additional mechanisms for determining whether
behavior is acceptable or not include checking for unexpected error messages
and checking exit statuses.

diffval evolved as a command-line tool for sanity checking changes before
commits.  You may find it fills a similar need for one of your projects,
or you may decide that it has a different niche for you, or no place at
all.  In any case your feedback on how and why you do (or don't!) use it
is welcome.
